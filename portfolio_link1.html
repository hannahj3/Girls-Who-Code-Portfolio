    <p>Scratch: Working with Scratch was extremely frustrating yet a necessary first step in understanding computer science.
      Instead of typing code, Scratch has pre-built blocks, easy to stack together to make things happen like a code would.
      This really allowed for the coding process to be visual and simplified, therefore building the basic understanding of the concpet of coding.</p>
